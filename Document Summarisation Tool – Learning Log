| 2025-07-10 | Project initiation               | Understood requirements, target output JSON/text summaries per document.        | Unsure how to chunk large PDFs for LLM summarisation.  | Plan to explore LangChain + PyPDF loader for chunking.     |
| 2025-07-12 | Environment & workflow setup     | Installed Python, VS Code, `langchain`, `pypdf`, `openai`, `chromadb`.          | Cleaning extracted text of repetitive headers/footers. | Added regex post-processing to clean extracted text.       |
| 2025-07-15 | LLM summarisation pipeline       | Tested summarisation using GPT-4o on chunks and merging.                        | Token limits with large chunks.                        | Used chunk-wise summarisation + final merged summary step. |
| 2025-07-18 | Output formatting & UI alignment | Decided structure: Title, bullet points, short summary. Discussed Streamlit UI. | Context loss when chunks split mid-topic.              | Overlap sentences between chunks to preserve context.      |
| 2025-07-22 | Testing with sample documents    | Used HR policy PDFs, marketing decks for testing.                               | Inaccurate results for scanned PDFs.                   | Plan to add Tesseract OCR support for scanned PDFs.        |
